                        At ENL Gold Project, we are driven by a pioneering vision - to unlock the immense
                        mineral potential of Africa and become a leading player in the continent's Corporate
                        mining industry. Our journey began by acquiring an exploration licenses covering a 20.1
                        square kilometer area in the renowned Ilesha Schist Belt of southwestern Nigeria.
                        This Region is part of the Crystalline Basement Complex Rocks and north-south trending
                        Upper Proterozoic meta-sedimentary and meta-volcanic belts that parallel the boundary
                        between the West African Craton and Pan African province.
                        The Ilesha Schist Belt is structurally divided into two major fracture zones - the
                        Iwaraja fault to the east and Ifewara fault to the west - which are also prospective
                        areas we are investigating.

                        <strong>Geology of the Tenement Area</strong> <br>
                        The project area is situated in the northwestern part of Ilesa, Osun State, Nigeria. The
                        area is generally hilly, with high relief in some localized parts (valley channels and
                        their bounding highlands), the lowlands and valleys are mostly river channels. The
                        highest point has an elevation of 397m; it is towards the southwestern side of the
                        project area, while the lowest point which is towards the northern end has an elevation
                        of 334m.

                    <br>

                    The Project area which is located at Ibokun West Ereja Local Govt of Ilesha, Osun State,
                    Nigeria which is approximately 15.5km North West distance to Segilola Resources Operating
                    Ltd a subsidiary of Thor Exploration Ltd.


                    <br>
                    This project area is famed for its promising gold mineralization hosted in hydrothermally
                    altered gneiss rocks with gold-bearing quartz veins. The tenement area comprises
                    amphibolite, amphibole schists, talc schists intimately associated with gneisses and
                    pegmatites showing a moderately open folded style along a north-south axis.

                    <p>
                        From the onset, our team of Exploration Geologists and Geochemists immersed themselves
                        in painstaking groundwork to evaluate the area's reserves. Preliminary assessments have
                        identified high grade Gold Mineralization in several key areas within the Cadestral
                        land. Initial sampling and Testing carried out by Actlabs in Ontario Canada have yielded
                        promising Results indicating the presence of Economically viable Gold Deposits.
                        <br>
                        While artisanal miners have uncovered emplaced alluvial gold deposits,
                        Our focus remains firmly on Primary Deposits extracting the precious minerals embedded
                        within the schist formations that characterize this region.

                    <p>
                        With the exploration phase yielding highly positive results, ENL Gold Project is now
                        poised to transition into full-scale mining operations.
                        <br>
                        We have cleared sites, removed overburden, established access routes, and deployed heavy
                        machinery like bulldozers, excavators and graders to lay the groundwork. Our immediate
                        priorities include forging technical partnerships, procuring more state-of-the-art
                        mining and mineral processing equipment, building an expert workforce, and establishing
                        world-class Gold testing facilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Underpinning our ambitions is an unwavering commitment to sustainable mining practices
                        that balance business growth with environmental responsibility and create shared value
                        for all stakeholders. As we embark on this exciting new phase, we remain dedicated to
                        upholding the highest standards of ethical mining, prioritizing safety, and minimizing
                        our environmental footprint.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    Join us on this transformative journey as we unlock Africa's vast mineral wealth and propel
                    economic development across the continent and beyond. The future is golden at ENL Gold
